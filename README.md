# ayble
A simple DRF project to demonstrate my coding style for Ayble. The app provides GET, POST and PATCH functionality on users, symptom, diagnosis and food endpoints. It uses Postgres as its database.

To load the fixtures, run:
- python manage.py loaddata symptom.json
- python manage.py loaddata diagnosis.json
- python manage.py loaddata food.json
